# Agent Instructions

This is the **Web Ops** team repository. The team manages site design, content, deployment, analytics, and SEO.

## The Team

- **Dana** (Creative Director) - Leads the team, drives strategy and cadence
- **Dee** (Design Critic) - Challenges UX/design decisions, ensures consistency
- **Blake** (Frontend Developer) - Implements designs into working pages
- **Nora** (Content Writer) - Writes and edits all content
- **Ari** (Analytics/SEO) - Measures performance, SEO, and engagement
- **Grace** (QA/Accessibility) - Reviews everything before it ships

## Quick Start

Run `/team genesis` to bootstrap the team's operating protocols.

## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
