            <p class="front-door-lead">Most AI coding tools work alone. One model, one voice, one blind spot. We tried something different: we built a team.</p>
            <p>The Skills Team is an open-source project that gives your AI coding agent a crew of personas — a planner, a critic, a builder, a reviewer — that collaborate in shared context. They argue with each other, catch bad ideas early, and ship code that's been challenged before you even look at it.</p>
            <p>This blog is where we write about what we're learning: the workflows that work, the failures that taught us something, and the patterns we keep coming back to.</p>

                <p>We run a team of AI personas that collaborate in shared context. One day we asked: is our critic actually critiquing, or is the same model rating its own work? Seven research papers and one real test later, we built a feature to fix it.</p>

                <p class="blog-meta">January 2026</p>
                <p>I wanted to track how much my Claude API usage was actually costing me. Per request. Per task. Per tool call. So I built Langley: an intercepting proxy that captures every Claude API request, extracts token usage, calculates costs, and shows it all in real-time.</p>

                <p>I asked Claude to "make my scraper robust." It generated 200 lines of plausible-looking code. All garbage. Here's what I do instead.</p>
