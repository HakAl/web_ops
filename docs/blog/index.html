                <p class="blog-meta">January 2026</p>
                <p>We run a team of AI personas that collaborate in shared context. One day we asked: is our critic actually critiquing, or is the same model rating its own work? Seven research papers and one real test later, we built a feature to fix it.</p>

                <p class="blog-meta">January 2026</p>
                <p>I asked Claude to "make my scraper robust." It generated 200 lines of plausible-looking code. All garbage. Here's what I do instead.</p>
